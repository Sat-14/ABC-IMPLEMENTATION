# 🛡️ Insight Platform: Key Features & Capabilities

## 1. verifiable Evidence Integrity
*   **Cryptographic Fingerprinting**: Every file is hashed (SHA-256) upon upload.
*   **Tamper Detection**: Automated integrity checks compare current file state against original fingerprints.
*   **Immutable Records**: Once evidence is locked, it cannot be altered without detection.

## 2. Digital Chain of Custody
*   **End-to-End Tracking**: Logs every user who views, downloads, or modifies evidence.
*   **Formal Transfer Workflow**: Structured process for handing over custody between officers or departments.
*   **Accountability**: "Current Custodian" status ensures one person is always responsible for the physical or digital asset.

## 3. Secure External Sharing
*   **Time-Limited Access**: Generate share links that expire automatically (e.g., 24 hours, 7 days).
*   **Access Logging**: potential to track when and by whom (IP/Email) the shared link was accessed.
*   **One-Click Revocation**: Instantly kill active links if security is compromised.
*   **Watermarked Previews**: Visual deterrents on shared media to prevent unauthorized distribution.

## 4. AI-Enhanced Forensics
*   **Automated Transcription**: Converts audio/video evidence into searchable text.
*   **Smart Summarization**: Generates concise narratives of custody history and evidence context.
*   **Risk Assessment**: AI algorithms flag potential issues like "Gap in Custody" or "Broken Chain of Integrity."

## 5. Comprehensive Audit Trail
*   **Granular Logging**: records specific actions like "Evidence viewed," "Verification failed," or "Transfer rejected."
*   **Forensic Watermarking**: Previews contain visible markers to prevent screen scraping.
*   **Exportable Reports**: Generate PDF reports detailing the full history of an evidence item for court proceedings.

## 6. Advanced Case Management
*   **Cross-Case Linking**: Connect a single piece of evidence to multiple investigations (e.g., a gun used in two crimes).
*   **Role-Based Access**: Strict permissions ensure detectives, supervisors, and auditors only see what they need.
*   **Geo-Tagging**: Visualizes evidence collection points on interactive maps.
